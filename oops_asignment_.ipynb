    "# 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Encapsulation: This is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This simplifies interaction with objects, allowing the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that is invoking them, typically achieved through method overriding or overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class and Object: While not always listed as a key concept separately, the foundation of OOP is the idea of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), defining the data structure and behavior, while an object is an instance of a class."

    "# 5. What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "1. Public\n",
    "Denotation: Attributes and methods that are meant to be accessible from outside the class are public. They are the default in Python, and there is no special syntax needed to define them.\n",
    "Usage: Public members can be accessed from anywhereâ€”inside the class, outside the class, and even from subclasses.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Car:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Protected\n",
    "Denotation: Protected members are indicated by a single underscore _ before the attribute or method name (e.g., _attribute).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Private\n",
    "Denotation: Private members are denoted by a double underscore __ before the attribute or method name (e.g., __attribute).\n",
    "Usage: Private members are intended to be accessible only within the class where they are defined. They are not directly accessible from outside the class, including from subclasses.

    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance.
